Summary¶

Cyclistic is a fictional startup which launched a successful bike-sharing program in 2016 with a fleet of 5,824 bikes and 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be picked up and returned to any station anytime. Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on appealing to a broad audience with flexible pricing options for single-ride, full-day, and annual passes. The company's finance analysts have determined that annual members are more profitable than casual riders, and their goal is to convert casual riders into members. To do this, the marketing team wants to better understand the differences between the two groups and use data analysis to identify trends.

Casual users ride on average longer than member users, but member users ride length doesn't fluctuate as much during the week.
Member users ride more often than casual riders, except on weekends and during the peak of the summer.
Member users follow predictable paths from and to the city center, whereas Casual users ride closer to leisure areas and follow less predictable paths.
